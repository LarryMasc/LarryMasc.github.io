<h2><a id="intro">Introduction</a></h2>

<p>
This document provides guidelines and best practices to be used when coding
Python Scripts. These best practices provide a foundational layer upon which
custom code can be written to perform the desired tasks. The common functions
are abstracted into separate configuration and utilities modules to be used as
appropriate.

<h4><a id="benefits">Benefits:</a></h4>

<ul>
Common Functions are reused thereby reducing the size of the script as well
as eliminating duplication of code. A change of functionality in a section
would require extensive rework across multiple scripts.
</ul>

<ul>
Easier debugging by the team. All scripts using common functions make debugging
significantly easier since the focus is on the custom code.
</ul>

<ul>
Easier maintenance. eg DB connections are defined in a single configuration
file. This makes changing DB credentials, host-name, ports etc very easy.
</ul>

<ul>
Tried and tested methodology. The entire industry uses this method.
</ul>

<ul>
A fix in the common code will benefit many scripts that use it.
</ul>

<h4><a id="cons">Cons:</a></h4>

<ul>
A bug in a common code can break several scripts. The industry has solved
this by using <em><strong>unittests</strong></em>
</ul>
